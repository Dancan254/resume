            <h1>Making Java Fun Again (It's Possible)</h1>
        </article>

        <section class="post-content">
            <p>
                For a long time, "Java" and "fun" were rarely used in the same sentence. The language was often
                criticized for its verbosity—boilerplate getters/setters, massive configuration XMLs (in the old days),
                and strict typing that felt restrictive rather than helpful.
            </p>
            <p>
                But if you haven't looked at Java since version 8, you're missing out on what feels like a completely
                different language. With the release of Java 21 LTS, the ecosystem is vibrant, modern, and surprisingly
                expressive.
            </p>

            <h3>1. Records: Goodbye Boilerplate</h3>
            <p>
                Remember writing a simple DTO (Data Transfer Object)? You needed a class, private final fields, a
                constructor, getters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`. Now?
            </p>
            <pre><code>public record User(String name, String email) {}</code></pre>
            <p>
                That is the entire class declaration. The compiler generates everything else for you. It’s immutable by
                default, perfect for domain-driven design and functional programming patterns.
            </p>

            <h3>2. Virtual Threads (Project Loom)</h3>
            <p>
                This is the game changer for backend engineers like me. Before, a Java thread mapped 1:1 to an operating
                system thread. This limited scalability because OS threads are expensive.
            </p>
            <p>
                Virtual threads are lightweight threads managed by the JVM. You can spawn <i>millions</i> of them
                without crashing your server.
            </p>
            <pre><code>try (var executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor()) {
    IntStream.range(0, 10_000).forEach(i -> {
        executor.submit(() -> {
            Thread.sleep(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
            return i;
        });
    });
}</code></pre>
            <p>
                This makes writing high-throughput concurrent applications almost as simple as writing sequential code.
                No need for complex reactive chains (Mono/Flux) unless you really want them.
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Java isn't the bulky enterprise dinosaur it used to be. It's evolving faster than ever (6-month release
                cycles!). If you're building backend systems in 2025, modern Java combined with Spring Boot 3 is a
                powerhouse that is genuinely joy to work with.
