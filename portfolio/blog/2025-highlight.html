        <section class="post-content">
            <p>
                Alright, deep breath. This is the kind of post you don’t rush. You let it breathe, like good code and
                strong tea.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is going to be a long post used to detail the people I met, the lessons I learned, and the journey
                that unfolded in ways I couldn’t have planned.
            </p>

            <h3>The Teaching Phase (Jan - May)</h3>
            <p>
                From <strong>January to May</strong>, my year revolved around one thing: <strong>teaching Java</strong>.
                Week after week, session after session, we organized community trainings focused on Java fundamentals.
                We focused on breaking concepts down, rebuilding confidence, and growing together. It wasn’t flashy, but
                it was consistent. And consistency, as I’ve learned, compounds quietly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Alongside this, through the <strong>Microsoft Student Ambassadors program</strong>, I was actively
                involved in training students and developers on <strong>deploying Java applications to Microsoft
                    Azure</strong>. Seeing people ship their first cloud-deployed apps never gets old. That moment when
                “it runs locally” becomes “it’s live” is simply magic.
            </p>

            <h3>Community Milestones</h3>
            <p>
                This journey introduced me to incredible people. One of the most memorable moments was meeting
                <strong>Dashan Kata</strong>. A brilliant engineer and an even better human. I invited him to speak at
                the <strong>Kenya Java User Group</strong>, and in <strong>May</strong>, we hosted our
                <strong>first-ever physical Java session in Kenya</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was my first time attending an event at JW Marriott (yes, that very expensive restaurant 😅) courtesy
                of Dashan. Great conversations, great food, and even greater lessons. That day felt like a milestone. It
                was proof that community work opens doors you didn’t even know existed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Earlier and later in the year, I also had the honor of hosting <strong>Venkat Subramaniam</strong> and
                <strong>Thomas Vitale</strong> at the Kenya Java User Group. Conversations with minds like theirs
                stretch you. You leave thinking differently about code, craft, and community. Hosting them wasn’t just
                an event; it was a reminder of how global and generous the Java ecosystem can be.
            </p>

            <h3>The Pivot: Interviews & Failure</h3>
            <p>
                I shared a lot about these sessions on LinkedIn. I did not have any grand strategy, I was just
                documenting the work. And that documentation opened doors. One of the most meaningful outcomes was
                connecting with <strong>Amigoscode</strong>. They reached out after seeing the consistency of our
                community efforts. What started as conversations turned into an <strong>Ask Me Anything session</strong>
                with the Kenya Java User Group.
            </p>
            <p>
                Around the same period, I was also doing <strong>hackathons</strong> with my friends
                <strong>Sylus</strong> and <strong>Samuel</strong>. We lost some, we won some, and we learned a lot.
                Hackathons have a way of stripping things down to the essentials: teamwork, speed, problem-solving, and
                resilience. Those nights mattered more than the certificates.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then came the <strong>Microsoft interview journey</strong>. It was bumpy. Some interviews went well,
                while others didn't go as planned. I ultimately didn’t make it through. At the time, it felt heavy.
                Looking back, it was a redirection.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because that failure led me exactly where I needed to be.
            </p>

            <h3>Where I Am Now</h3>
            <p>
                I joined <strong>Amigoscode</strong> as a <strong>Software Engineer and Technical Mentor</strong>. In
                this role, I now spend most of my time helping students navigate <strong>data structures and
                    algorithms</strong>, running <strong>mock interviews</strong>, and preparing them for real technical
                interviews. In many ways, it tied everything together: teaching, interviewing, learning, and community.
            </p>
            <p>
                All this happened while I was also <strong>pushing through my final year of study</strong>, showing up
                for my parents when they needed support, and learning what balance actually means (still learning,
                honestly).
            </p>
            <p>
                None of this would have been possible without the guidance of my <strong>mentor</strong>, whose wisdom
                and steady support kept me grounded through the highs and the disappointments.
            </p>

            <h3>Lessons for 2026</h3>
            <p>
                This year taught me that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Teaching attracts opportunity</li>
                <li>Community creates visibility</li>
                <li>Failure redirects, not rejects</li>
                <li>And consistency beats talent when talent gets tired</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                To everyone I met, taught, learned from, built with, and failed alongside, thank you.
                This year changed me. And I’m walking into the next one clearer, calmer, and more committed than ever.
            </p>
            <p>
                Onward 🚀
